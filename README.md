## What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is a Object Data Mapper (ODM) library (or Object Modeling Modeler) for MongoDB and Node.js, and allows your Node.js app to (which speaks the JavaScript language) to talk to the MongoDB database.  The primary objective of the Mongoose framework is to simply the writing of validation code, business logic boiler plate, and make the code shorter and easier to work with. 

In more technical terms, Mongoose provides a modeling enviroment for your data, enforcing structure while maintaing flexibility. Mongoose manages realtionships between data, providing schema validation, and is used between objects in code and the representation of those object in MongoDB.
